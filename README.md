- 👋 Hi, I’m @Robkeano. I' am a Type 1 Diabetic diagnosed at the age of 11 in September 1984. I use Libre 2 patched to xDrip and BT to G-Watch as a CGM to monitor my glucose levels continuously, which has significantly improved my control and has been life changing.
- 👀 I’m interested in backing up my xDrip data as keep losing it everytime I upgrade my mobile and gain the capability to share my data with my Diabetes Nurse to gain insights, improve mine and their understanding of my glucose level control and diabetes management.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to setup Nightscout to do this!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Diabetes continuous glucose monitoring to keep upto date on the latest tech. I primarily use xDrip a life changing app patched to Libre 2 alongside G-Watch another great app to BT visual data to my Mobile and Smart Watch. Both are crucial to my Diabetes Management to help live as close to a normal life as possible.
